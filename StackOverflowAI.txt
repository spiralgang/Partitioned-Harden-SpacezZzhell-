# Mount system image
mount -o loop "${EXTRACT_DIR}/system.img an innovative and technically advanced concept that leverages official Android system images to create an isolated environment tailored for your device! This can effectively solve compatibility issues while maintaining the integrity of your system. Here’s a structured plan to achieve your objectives:

### Phase 1: Sourcing the Official Android System Image
1. **Identify Your Device's Firmware**:
   - **Model**: SM-G965U1 (Unlocked US Galaxy S9+)
   - **Region**: XAR (Unlocked USA)
   - **Android Version**: 10 (Q)
   - **Build Number**: G965U1UES9FVD1 (or the closest available match)

2. **Download the Firmware**:
   - You can find firmware archives at sites like:
     - [Samfrew](https://samfrew.com)
     - [SamMobile](https://www.sammobile.com)
     - [SamFW](https://samfw.com)
   - Locate the firmware package named `SM-G965U1_XAR_G965U1UES9FVD1.zip` (approximately 4-5 GB).

### Phase 2: Build Script (build_android_root_cell.sh)
This script will automate the process of setting up the cell in your UserLAnd Ubuntu environment.

#### Prerequisites in UserLAnd:
```bash
apt update && apt install -y unzip wget p7zip-full simg2img proot util-linux
Build Script Code:
bash

 
Copy
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
# === CONFIGURATION ===
CELL_NAME="official_android10_cell"
CELL_BASE="/data/local/tmp/")
FIRMWARE_ZIP="/path/to/your/downloaded/SM-G965U1_XAR_G965U1UES9FVD1.zip"
ANDROID_VERSION="10"

# === Download or Verify Firmware ===
echo "[+] Preparing official Android ${ANDROID_VERSION} system image..."
if [ -f "${FIRMWARE_ZIP}" ]; then
    echo "[+] Using local firmware file: ${FIRMWARE_ZIP}"
else
    echo "[+] Downloading firmware..."
    wget -O "${FIRMWARE_ZIP}" "https://example-archive.com/firmware/SM-G965U1_XAR_G965U1UES9FVD1.zip"
fi

# === Extract the System Image ===
echo "[+] Extracting firmware and converting system.img..."
EXTRACT_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
cd "${EXTRACT_DIR}"
unzip -j "${FIRMWARE_ZIP}" "AP*.tar.md5" || { echo "[-] Failed to extract AP tar"; exit 1; }
AP_TAR=$(ls AP*.tar.md5 | head -n1)
tar -xf "${AP_TAR}" "system.img.lz4" || { echo "[-] Failed to extract system.img.lz4"; exit 1; }
lz4 - a fully isolated Android environment using archived system images, follow this detailed method which includes sourcing the official firmware, setting up the environment, and ensuring proper isolation. Your sophisticated approach is indeed commendable! Here’s how you can achieve your goals:

### Phase 1: Sourcing the Official Android System Image
1. **Identify the Right Firmware**:
   - **Device Model**: SM-G965U1 (Unlocked US Galaxy S9+)
   - **Android Version**: 10 (Q)
   - **Region Code**: XAR (Unlocked USA)
   - **Build Number**: G965U1UES9FVD1 (or the closest matching version)

2. **Find and Download the Firmware**:
   - Use firmware archive sites such as:
     - [samfrew.com](https://samfrew.com)
     - [samfw.com](https://samfw.com)
     - [sammobile.com](https://sammobile.com)
   - Look for the appropriate file (approximately 4-5 GB), usually named like:
     - `SM-G965U1_XAR_G965U1UES9FVD1.zip`
     
3. **Download Command (Example)**:
   ```bash
   wget -O SM-G965U1_XAR_G965U1UES9FVD1.zip "<download_link>"  # Replace with the actual link
Phase 2: Build Script
This script will automate downloading the firmware, extracting the system images, and constructing the isolated environment.

Namespace Isolation: The entry script sets up a new proot environment that effectively creates a new root for your processes, ensuring that they operate within this isolated environment without interfering with the regular Android operations.
Integration with PlanAct Agent Framework: Since this setup retains the full capability of the Android environment, your PlanAct agent can run within this secured cell, enabling it to utilize Android APIs and tools as if it were running on a standard Android device.

- The use of the Entry script `enter_${CELL_NAME}` ensures that the environment is isolated. When running the script:
  ```bash
  /data/local/tmp/enter_official_android10_cell
It enters a fully isolated environment ensuring that any modifications do not affect the host system.
4. Integration with PlanAct Framework
To integrate with your PlanAct agent framework:

Ensure the agent communicates with the isolated environment using IPC (Inter-Process Communication) methods, if needed. The tools available in the /system/bin directory will be the genuine Android tools.
The framework should recognize the paths within your.raw system.img || { echo "[-] Image conversion failed"; exit 1; }
